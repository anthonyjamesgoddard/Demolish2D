BUGZ:

-   There is an issue with (current) object 3.
    we are getting an empty finest level of detail 
    for the last sector. 


IDEAS

+   We can get away with halving the memory cost of an object.
    ...Possibly more: 
    
    Do we actually need to store the finest level
    of detail geometry and the lowest level of detail geometry
    AS WELL AS the convex hull and the geometry itself?!

    Hence we might acutally beable to EITHER reduce _LoD by 2
    for each object or even remove the data members _convexHull
    and _geomtery. 
    
    In addition to this we can have some sort of friend class
    set up that would inextricably link the vertices with a 
    sector. This would reduce the cost of transitioning through
    the levels of details to almost nothing. Currently we have
    to search through the soctors untill we arrive at the particular angle.

    Resolution:
        Leave this to be implemented in 2.0 or kept in mind for demolish
        in 3D.

+   We need to transition to storing vertices on heap using shared_ptr's.
    At the very least this should be implemented in the next increment or
    even in the final 3D product
