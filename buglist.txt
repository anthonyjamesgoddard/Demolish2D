+   We can get away with halving the memory cost of an object.
    ...Possibly more: 
    
    Do we actually need to store the finest level
    of detail geometry and the lowest level of detail geometry
    AS WELL AS the convex hull and the geometry itself?!

    Hence we might acutally beable to EITHER reduce _LoD by 2
    for each object or even remove the data members _convexHull
    and _geomtery. 
    
    Leave this to be implemented in 2.0 or kept in mind for demolish
    in 3D.
