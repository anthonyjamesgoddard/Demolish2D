BUGZ:

-   Report 17/10/2018:
        There is an issue with (current) object 3.
        we are getting an empty finest level of detail 
        for the last sector. 
    Update 17/10/2018:
        Squashed that MF. Issue resolved.



IDEAS:

+   We can get away with halving the memory cost of an object.
    ...Possibly more: 
    
    Do we actually need to store the finest level
    of detail geometry and the lowest level of detail geometry
    AS WELL AS the convex hull and the geometry itself?!

    Hence we might acutally beable to EITHER reduce _LoD by 2
    for each object or even remove the data members _convexHull
    and _geomtery.  

+   We need to transition to storing vertices on heap using shared_ptr's.
    At the very least this should be implemented in the next increment or
    even in the final 3D product
