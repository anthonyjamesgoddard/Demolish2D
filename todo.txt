1. Add functionality to draw the scene to the screen
    + in doing this we might find that our centroid/matParams
        routine needs changing. That is, do we subtract the 
        centroid from all vertices to maintain consistency?

        NO:
            The centroid of the convex hull and the non-convex
            shape will be inheriently different.

            BUT...
        YES:
            We could just make use of the ACTUAL geometries centroid
            to do this. basically using the centroid of _geometry
            as the pseudo-centroid of the convex hull.

            This could be added as a method of Object.
            centreGeometry()??
            subtracts the centroid from the vertices of the 
            object itself and the convex hull. If this is called
            before the sector formation routine we would not have to
            change much?


2. Start adding collision detection code.
