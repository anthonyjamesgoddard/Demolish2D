We need to think about what we do when the convex hull
has been breached. 

We already have the sectors in place but have no easy way 
to correlate breached edges (at collision time) with
the sectors represented by the edge that has been breached.

- redesign?
    - Create sectors on the fly?
    - ...

- do away with the sector idea?
    - what instead?
    - we could temp. do away with sector idea
        and consider a triple level
        + bounding circle
        + convex hull
        + actual (local) geometry
